## The Algorithm

I collected images from google. The dataset I made contained 200 images of people with masks and 200 images of people without masks. I split this data set in an 80-10-10 ratio for training, testing, and validation respectively. I retrained resnet-18 with my dataset on the Jetson Nano Developer Kit.
